# 📘 Math Tutor in Decimal Numbers
An interactive educational game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Reveal.js), designed to help students understand and compare decimal numbers through guided tutorials, audio-visual feedback, and quiz-based practice.

---

## 🔍 Overview
This interactive math game is built using Reveal.js and custom JavaScript/CSS. It is designed to teach decimal structure and place values through engaging tutorials and gamified multiple-choice questions.  
It is based on research highlighting the cognitive difficulties students face when comparing decimals. The design integrates gradual explanation, visual scaffolding, and auditory support to improve understanding for all learners—especially those with learning disabilities.

## 🌍 Language Support
- **Hebrew**
- **Arabic**

Both languages include full audio instructions, ensuring accessibility for students with reading difficulties.

## 📚 Research Background
This project is based on two articles:
1. *Why is learning fraction and decimal arithmetic so difficult?*
2. *Inhibitory control and decimal number comparison in school-aged children*

These studies emphasize how students often misinterpret decimals due to visual bias and lack of conceptual understanding (e.g., thinking 0.14 is greater than 0.4). The game directly addresses this by:
- Using a “House of Numbers” to break down decimal structure
- Forcing side-by-side alignment on a number line
- Giving detailed feedback regardless of whether the answer was right or wrong

The game supports self-paced learning and encourages meaningful interaction—two principles known to increase engagement and retention for students with learning difficulties.
